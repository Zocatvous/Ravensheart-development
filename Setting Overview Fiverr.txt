Hey There, 

I am writing a fantasy world that has a bunch of different "Royal Houses" each based upon a different real world culture. Currently I am aiming for a song that creates a really almost "heartwarming" eastern traditional sound. ala. Yari, strings. For one of the oldest households in the setting.

 A really good inspiration that Im hoping you will draw from is the song "Secret Place by Clozee" link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soLrXM0EQ8c&ab_channel=xKitoMusic While it is sort of a chill/trap rythm (which Im hoping to replace with something more traditional) The instrumentals are almost exactly what I am looking for in the melody. In the lower range of sounds Im hoping to mimic some of the gravity and punch of this track link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McDARzZIw_I&ab_channel=UbisoftMusic It has this sort of Vast Dark undertone that I really love, and fits the setting more generally. If I'm hoping that with these two links I can create a suite of main "themes" for this setting that can serve as the underpinnings for themes in the songs for the other "Houses". If the first theme or set of themes is good I will be submitting requests for at least 9 more songs :)


I included a brief overview and some artwork from the setting that I have drawn that will hopefully give you a taste of how at least the first track should sound. :)

I hope you enjoy and feel inspired to make something awesome :)

The Story Im writing is about the history and drama taking place in this city - filled with other cities. It is old, Filled with a variety of different cultures and brimming with intrigue and adventure. 

Im hoping to get a theme that can encompass the emotion of the whole setting. Preferably on a stringed instrument similiar to the one in the sample. Let me know if you have any questions, If you would like other songs that have themes simliar to the 

Thank you!
